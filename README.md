# chooChooTrainSchedule

The objective of the Train Schedule homework was to allow someone, on any computer, be able to add a new train to the schedule. Additionally, the current train schedule shows up-to-date information about the trains, including their next arrival time, how often they depart, and how far away the train currently is. This information is stored in Firebase and utilizes moment.js to manipulate the data.
