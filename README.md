# Full Stack Train Schedule

The objective of the Train Schedule homework was to allow someone - on any computer - be able to add a new train to the schedule, along with viewing up-to-date information on the scheduled trains, including their next arrival time, how often they depart, and how far away the train currently is. This information is stored in Firebase and utilizes moment.js to manipulate the data.

## Technology Used
* HTML/CSS
* jQuery
* Firebase
* Moment.js
* Materialize CSS Library

## Issues
My delete button removes from the data from the table but not from the database. I will have to dig deeper into this.
